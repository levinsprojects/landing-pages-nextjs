As a small-medium business owner, it’s important to prioritize security on your website. One aspect of website security that is often overlooked is the use of security headers.

These headers, which are included in the HTTP response of a web server, provide an extra layer of protection against a variety of cyber threats, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and content injection attacks.

## Don’t Risk Your Business Website: Use Security Headers

Ignoring security headers can leave your business vulnerable to data breaches, which can have far-reaching consequences. A data breach can result in loss of customer trust, damage to your reputation, and loss of revenue. In fact, the average cost of a data breach for a small to medium-sized business is estimated at $38,000.

But the financial cost is not the only concern – the impact on your reputation can be even more damaging. As the CEO of cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes, Marcin Kleczynski, warns:

> A data breach can ruin a company’s reputation overnight, leading to lost customers and revenue.

With cyber attacks becoming increasingly common and sophisticated, it’s more important than ever to prioritize security. According to the cybersecurity firm Symantec, the number of detected cyber attacks increased by 36% in 2020 alone. Don’t risk your business – use security headers to protect against potential threats.

### How to Check Your Website’s Security Headers

Before you can implement security headers on your website, it’s important to know what headers are already in place. You can check your website’s security headers using a tool such as [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/) or [SSL Labs](https://securityheaders.com/). These tools will scan your website and provide a report on the security headers that are in use, as well as any recommendations for improvement.

Once you have a list of your website’s security headers, you can begin the process of implementing and configuring additional headers as needed.

### Common Security Headers to Consider

There are several different types of security headers that you can use to protect your website. Here are a few common security headers that you may want to consider implementing:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** The CSP header helps to prevent content injection attacks by specifying which domains are allowed to load resources on your website. This helps to prevent malicious actors from injecting unwanted content, such as spam or malicious code, into your website.
- **Permissions Policy:** The permissions policy header allows you to specify which permissions your website requires, such as access to the user’s location or camera. This helps to prevent malicious actors from gaining access to sensitive information without the user’s consent.
- **Referrer Policy:** The referrer policy header controls how much information is sent to other websites when a user clicks a link. This can help to protect against data leaks and improve privacy for your users.
- **Strict Transport Security (STS):** The STS header helps to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by enforcing the use of secure connections (HTTPS) for your website. This helps to ensure that the connection between your website and the user’s browser is secure and encrypted.
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** The X-Content-Type-Options header helps to protect against content injection attacks by preventing the browser from executing content that is not of the specified type.
- **X-Frame-Options:** The X-Frame-Options header helps to prevent clickjacking attacks by specifying whether or not your website can be displayed in a frame.
- **X-XSS-Protection:** The X-XSS-Protection header helps to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by enabling the browser’s built-in XSS protection.

## The Benefits of Using Security Headers

But it’s not just about protecting against cyber attacks – using security headers can also have tangible benefits for your business. For one, it can improve your website’s search engine ranking, as search engines like Google place a higher value on websites that prioritize security. In the words of Google’s Webmaster Trends Analyst, Gary Illyes:

> Security is a top priority for Google. We are constantly working to ensure that our search results are as safe as possible.

Using security headers can also enhance trust and loyalty from customers and clients, as it demonstrates that you are taking steps to protect sensitive information and data. By implementing and properly configuring security headers, you can show your commitment to security and dedication to protecting your customers’ data.

## How to Implement Security Headers on Your Website

So how can you ensure that security headers are included on your website? Here are a few tips to get you started:

- Choose the right security headers: There are several different types of security headers, each with its own specific function. Some common security headers include the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, which helps prevent content injection attacks, and the X-XSS-Protection header, which helps protect against XSS attacks. Carefully consider which security headers are most relevant to your website and your business needs.
- Configure security headers correctly: Properly configuring security headers is crucial for their effectiveness. This may involve setting specific values or parameters for each header, such as specifying which domains are allowed to load resources or which types of content are permitted. Be sure to follow best practices and guidelines when configuring security headers.
- Review and update security headers regularly: Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and it’s important to keep your security headers up to date to ensure that they are effective. Review your security headers on a regular basis and update them as needed to stay ahead of potential threats.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, security headers are a crucial aspect of website security that should not be overlooked. By implementing and properly configuring security headers, you can improve your protection against cyber threats and enhance trust from customers and clients. Don’t wait until it’s too late – start using security headers on your website today to protect your business.
